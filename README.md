# Sparking Zero DP Possibility Calculator
This repo contains a script for calculating the possible combinations for online teams in Dragonball Sparking Zero. 

For further context, the game allows you to battle players online. However, given the extensive roster and the unbalanced nature of the game, the decision was made to limit the amount of characters you can choose to play with. 

## Rules
Each player costs DP (Duel Points).

Each player costs between 1 and 10 DP to place in your team.

You can have a maximum of 5 players on a team. 

But, you have a maximum of 15 DP to spend per team.  

## What the Script Does
This script lists all possible combinations of DP cost. 

## Future Iterations
At some point in the future I hope to turn this into an application that allows you to build a team around a specific character. (i.e. your main character).
